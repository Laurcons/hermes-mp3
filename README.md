# Hermes MP3 Experience - Platform App

The [Societatea Hermes](https://societatea-hermes.ro), that I volunteer at, is organizing the Computer Science & Maths Students Week ([SSMI](https://ssmi.societatea-hermes.ro/)) and one of the activities is so unique that I identified a use case for a web application.

The activity is called MP3 Experience and it is based on the participants hearing a live radio stream in their headphones and being asked to do various funny stuff. This Platform App exists to make the event unique, enjoyable, and easier to manage for us as volunteers.

## Technical details

The Platform is a web single-page application with a backend written in TypeScript with Nest.JS, database-backed by Mongo and using Socket.IO for real-time communication, and a frontend in good-old (but newest version of) React with TypeScript.

It is hosted on DigitalOcean, and I wholeheartedly recommend them for hosting your projects (prototypes or prod-ready stuff). If you're interested, you can use [my referral code](https://m.do.co/c/72172f34b447) to get $200 to do with as you please.
